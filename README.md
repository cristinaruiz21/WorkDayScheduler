# WorkDayScheduler
Purpose: To make people's day-to-day life more organized. This daily scheduler will allow you to create events for each hour during the work day and save them for future reference. It also allows you to see what time of the day you are currently in by color coding the past, present, and future. 

How to Use: Start by clicking in the middle, blank, column at your desired time. Type in your event details and click the blue save button on the right hand column. Your events will be stored even if you refresh the page. 

Lessons Learned: I learned how to use the localStorage feature, which allows the user to save their typed information even after refreshing the page. I also learned how to use Moment.JS when adding/comparing the current day and time.
